                            In the summer of 1970, I stood on the cliffs overlooking a small beach in Costa Mesa, California, a young Jewish filmmaker with a camera on my shoulder. I'd been asked to produce a documentary on what was happening below—thousands of hippies singing Jesus songs, getting baptized in the Pacific Ocean at Pirates Cove. Just another assignment, I thought. Just another California oddity I was looking to capture on film. As I watched through my lens, something unexpected happened. The scene below wasn't just religious theater. These young people—long-haired, barefoot, many still bearing the marks of hard living—were rejoicing, and profoundly real. They waded into the waves, singing, weeping, and embracing one another as they were baptized. Some had to be carried out of the water, so overcome were they by what they'd experienced.

                            I was witnessing God's answer to a lost generation that had been shaken to its core. Vietnam had torn the nation apart. Cities burned with racial unrest—nationally beloved leaders were assassinated, and once respected institutions crumbled. Young people who'd grown up in prosperity found themselves adrift in a sea of LSD and other drugs, the "free love" movement, all ending up in existential despair. Everything their parents had built around them seemed to be collapsing.

                            America in the 1950s experienced unprecedented blessing—prosperity, global influence, and church attendance at historic highs. But blessing bred complacency. By the early 1960s, that complacency had turned to rebellion. Prayer was expelled from classrooms in 1962.

                            The sexual revolution torched traditional values. Drug use exploded. Then came the shaking—the Vietnam war claimed 58,000 American lives while the nation watched on television. President John F. Kennedy was assassinated in 1963. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., was murdered in April 1968, followed by Senator Robert F. Kennedy just two months later.

                            What will be your response? History reveals a powerful pattern: after every great national crisis (shaking) comes a window of opportunity for renewal and reformation. That same opportunity stands before us now.

                            This book is not a message of doom—it is a call to destiny. In the midst of shaking, God is summoning His people to rise in His strength and stand unshakable. It's not just about weathering the storm—it's about being Spirit-led into revival and rebuilding new, godly foundations that will stand firm in the days to come.

                            Great shaking often precedes great transformation. In such times, foundations are tested—what is built on sand will fall, but what is anchored to the Rock of God's Word will endure. And from what endures, we are given a divine opportunity: to rebuild, to reform, and to restore according to God's original design. How will you rebuild?

                            Standing on those cliffs in 1970, I faced a choice that would cost me everything. I could remain a detached observer, filming from above, or I could set down my camera and join what God was doing. But for a Jewish man, embracing Jesus meant exile from family, community, identity itself. That choice—between comfortable distance and costly discipleship—confronts us all when Heaven breaks into our carefully controlled world.

                <p class="page-text">
                    In the summer of 1970, I stood on the cliffs overlooking a small beach in Costa Mesa, California, a young Jewish filmmaker with a camera on my shoulder. I'd been asked to produce a documentary on what was happening below—thousands of hippies singing Jesus songs, getting baptized in the Pacific Ocean at Pirates Cove. Just another assignment, I thought. Just another California oddity I was looking to capture on film.
                </p>
                <p class="page-text">
                    As I watched through my lens, something unexpected happened. The scene below wasn't just religious theater. These young people—long-haired, barefoot, many still bearing the marks of hard living—were rejoicing, and profoundly real. They waded into the waves, singing, weeping, and embracing one another as they were baptized. Some had to be carried out of the water, so overcome were they by what they'd experienced.
                </p>

                    I was witnessing God's answer to a lost generation that had been shaken to its core. Vietnam had torn the nation apart. Cities burned with racial unrest—nationally beloved leaders were assassinated, and once respected institutions crumbled. Young people who'd grown up in prosperity found themselves adrift in a sea of LSD and other drugs, the "free love" movement, all ending up in existential despair. Everything their parents had built around them seemed to be collapsing.

                <p class="page-text">
                    That day on the cliffs, I was deeply challenged, marking the beginning of a lifelong journey—a journey that would lead me to encounter Jesus as my Messiah and where I would come to understand the generational patterns that brought us to that point.

                    That pursuit would take me five decades to grasp fully—a divine cycle that pulses through history. When human structures fail catastrophically, when society reaches a breaking point, when people cry out in desperation, God begins to move. He always has. He always will.

                    The signs are everywhere, yet many remain asleep. What we're seeing is not just political, social, or economic—it's prophetic. What God revealed to me in a vision decades ago is a warning of what will happen if we do not wake up and turn to Him. That warning now feels imminent.

                <p class="page-text">
                    In 1984, long before anyone was talking about cultural collapse or a coming shaking, God gave me a vision that has marked me ever since.
                </p>
                <p class="page-text">
                    During a time of prayer, I suddenly seemed no longer in my room. In the vision, I stood gazing out over a desolate landscape blanketed with collapsed buildings and broken structures. As far as the eye could see, there was vast devastation—heaps of rubble, cracked foundations, and twisted debris. It reminded me of those haunting images from Hiroshima—total destruction where life once thrived.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="mobile-page">
                <p class="page-text">
                    But it wasn't just the destruction that gripped me—it was the people. They wandered among the ruins with expressions of utter shock and bewilderment. They had built their lives, their organizations, and their institutions on faulty foundations that couldn't hold up under the shaking.
                </p>
                <p class="page-text">
                    The Lord spoke: "They built on sand, believing it would hold. They chose speed over depth, appearance over substance. Now the shaking reveals what was always true—only what is built on My Word will remain."
                </p>
                <p class="page-text">
                    "When, Lord?" I asked.
                </p>
                <p class="page-text">
                    "It has already begun," He said. "But the greater shaking is yet to come."

                <div class="section-heading">Recognizing the Divine Pattern</div>
                <p class="page-text">
                    Throughout Scripture, God's pattern remains consistent:
                </p>
                <div class="quote-block" style="font-size: 15px; font-weight: normal; font-style: italic;">
                    Blessing - Complacency - Rebellion - Shaking - Repentance - Restoration
                </div>
                <p class="page-text">
                    <strong>In Judges:</strong> For nearly 400 years, Israel repeated this pattern. Seven times they cycled through blessing, rebellion, oppression, crying out, and deliverance. Each generation forgot the lessons of the previous one.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="mobile-page">
                <p class="page-text">
                    <strong>In Jeremiah:</strong> God revealed this pattern once again to an entire nation facing judgment. In this recurring cycle, God faithfully demonstrated His mercy even in judgment—always leaving a remnant, always providing a path back through repentance.
                </p>
                <div class="scripture">
                    <em>"Therefore, this is what the Lord says: 'If you repent, I will restore you that you may serve Me...'"</em> (Jer. 15:19).
                </div>
                <p class="page-text">
                    <strong>In Israel's monarchy:</strong> From David's glory to exile in Babylon—the pattern played out over centuries. Solomon's wisdom gave way to idolatry. Revival under Hezekiah was followed by rebellion under Manasseh.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="mobile-page">
                <p class="page-text">
                    <strong>In the Early Church:</strong> Even the New Testament church experienced these cycles. The passion of Pentecost cooled into the lukewarm Laodicea. Paul warned Timothy that <em>"there will be terrible times in the last days"</em> (2 Tim. 3:1).
                </p>
                <p class="page-text">
                    This divine pattern reveals three truths:
                </p>
                <p class="page-text">
                    • Before judgment comes, God gives space for mercy and repentance.<br>
                    • Shaking is meant to bring awakening, not desolation.<br>
                    • A godly remnant always emerges to rebuild on truth.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="mobile-page">
                <p class="page-text">
                    Consider how this pattern played out before the Jesus Movement I witnessed: America in the 1950s experienced unprecedented blessing. But blessing bred complacency. By the early 1960s, that complacency had turned to rebellion. Prayer was expelled from classrooms in 1962. The sexual revolution torched traditional values. Drug use exploded.
                </p>
                <p class="page-text">
                    Then came the shaking—the Vietnam war, assassinations of President Kennedy, Dr. King, and Senator Robert Kennedy. Cities burned. The National Guard occupied universities. Everything that once seemed unshakable was shaken apart.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="mobile-page">
                <p class="page-text">
                    It was in the midst of that shaking that God moved. The "Jesus People" Movement wasn't the shaking—it was heaven's response to a generation that had been shaken back to desperation for truth.
                </p>
                <p class="page-text">
                    This is why the shaking is actually mercy. As Hebrews 12:27 reveals, God shakes <em>"so that what cannot be shaken may remain."</em> He allows the breaking to produce blessing. He permits the collapse of false foundations, so we'll build on true ones.

                <div class="section-heading">More Than Historical Cycles</div>
                <p class="page-text">
                    God's patterns of shaking aren't random—they follow a divine rhythm so consistent that even secular historians have recognized it. In their landmark book <em>The Fourth Turning</em>, William Strauss and Neil Howe documented what believers have long understood: history moves in cycles.
                </p>
                <p class="page-text">
                    These historians discovered that societies move through four distinct seasons roughly every 80-100 years: "The High," "The Awakening," "The Unraveling," and "The Crisis" (Fourth Turning).

            </div>

                <p class="page-text">
                    America has experienced three previous Fourth Turnings: The American Revolution (1770s-1780s), The Civil War (1860s), and The Great Depression/World War II (1929-1945). Each brought total transformation.
                </p>
                <p class="page-text">
                    But here's what secular historians miss: behind every cultural shaking is a divine purpose. What they call generational patterns, the Bible reveals as God's redemptive rhythm.
                </p>
                <p class="page-text">
                    We're not merely repeating cycles but moving in a spiral. Each turning intensifies; each crisis is more global. Technology has compressed time; what took decades now happens in years.

                    Jesus Himself described escalating birth pains in Matthew 24—each wave more intense than the last, all pointing toward His return. We're accelerating toward that culmination, when every shaking gives way to the eternal Kingdom that cannot be shaken.

                <p class="page-text">
                    I recently joined prophetic leaders from thirty-two nations for a three-day gathering in Dallas, Texas. The voices around the table confirmed what I've been sensing: a greater shaking is coming to America and the world.

                <p class="page-text">
                    These prophetic voices proclaim that the coming shaking will be more intense and expansive than most of us are expecting—and that out of this upheaval, a Greater Spiritual Awakening will arise, triggering a massive harvest more abundant than the Church is currently prepared to disciple.
                </p>
                <p class="page-text">
                    This will not be easy. The coming waves of disruption will test even mature believers. But our Mighty God is calling us to <em>"Arise, shine, for your light has come, and the glory of the LORD rises upon you"</em> (Isa. 60:1-2).

                    People often ask me, "Some prophets say a great shaking is coming. Others say a massive revival is coming. Which is right?" I say—both. The shaking and the outpouring are not opposites—they are partners. The shaking clears the ground. The outpouring fills it.
                </p>
                <p class="page-text">
                    Revival is coming, yes. But so is a tumultuous shaking. We must prepare for both.

                <p class="page-text">
                    As Hebrews 12:26-27 declares: <em>"Once more I will shake not only the earth but also the heavens...so that what cannot be shaken may remain."</em>

                <p class="page-text">
                    This book is not a message of doom—it is a call to destiny. In the midst of shaking, God is summoning His people to rise in His strength and stand unshakable. It's not just about weathering the storm—it's about being Spirit-led into revival and rebuilding new, godly foundations that will stand firm in the days to come.

                    Standing on those cliffs in 1970, I faced a choice that would cost me everything. That choice—between comfortable distance and costly discipleship—confronts us all when Heaven breaks into our carefully controlled world.

                    The shaking isn't meant to destroy you—it's meant to free you from everything that's not eternal. It's an invitation to build your life, your family, and community on the only foundation that will stand: Jesus Christ.
